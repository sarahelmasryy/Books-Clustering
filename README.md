# Books-Clustering

Countries all over the world have different cultures. One of the things that portray these differences
is children’s books, precisely fairy tale stories. For this assignment, we thought it’d be interesting
to analyze different children’s fairy tales across different countries. These books are semantically
similar because they’re fairy tales directed to children. However, each book has its own cultural
impact and different genres that it represents. You can imagine princess Mulan in China vs princess
Snow White in Europe. Books used:
1. Japanese Fairy Tales by Yei Theodora Ozaki (Japan)
2. Indian Fairy Tales by Joseph Jacobs and John Dickson Batten (India)
3. Russian Fairy Tales: A Choice Collection of Muscovite Folk-lore by Ralston (Russia)
4. Dutch Fairy Tales for Young Folks by William Elliot Griffis (Netherlands)
5. American Fairy Tales by L. Frank Baum
